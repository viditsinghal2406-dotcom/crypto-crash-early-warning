CRYPTO CRASH EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM  FINAL NOTES

--------------------------------------------------
ONE-LINE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
Built a data-driven framework to objectively detect
high-risk crypto market regimes using drawdowns and
a composite risk index derived from volume, volatility,
and price behavior.

--------------------------------------------------
CORE IDEA
--------------------------------------------------
This project focuses on risk detection, not price prediction.
Crashes are treated as structural market regimes that emerge
from accumulated stress rather than sudden single events.

--------------------------------------------------
DATA FOUNDATION
--------------------------------------------------
- Asset: Bitcoin (BTC)
- Frequency: Daily OHLCV data
- Source: Exchange data via ccxt
- Raw data is collected once and saved before analysis
- Daily timeframe chosen to capture market structure over noise

--------------------------------------------------
CRASH DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------
Crashes are defined using drawdowns:

Drawdown = (Price - Historical Peak) / Peak

Interpretation:
- 0        → all-time high
- ≤ -20%  → stress regime
- ≤ -30%  → crash regime
- ≤ -50%  → severe crash

Drawdowns provide an objective, peak-to-trough measure
of market losses.

--------------------------------------------------
EARLY-WARNING RISK SIGNALS
--------------------------------------------------
Three interpretable signals are used:

1. Volume Stress
   - Measures abnormal trading activity
   - Captures panic, urgency, and distribution

2. Volatility Expansion
   - Measures market instability
   - Signals transitions from calm to stressed regimes

3. Drawdown Momentum
   - Measures acceleration of losses
   - Indicates worsening downside pressure

Each signal captures a different dimension of risk.

--------------------------------------------------
WHY SIGNALS ARE COMBINED
--------------------------------------------------
Single indicators are noisy and unreliable.
Combining multiple weak signals reduces false alarms
and improves confidence in identifying high-risk regimes.

--------------------------------------------------
COMPOSITE RISK INDEX
--------------------------------------------------
- Signals are normalized using rolling percentiles
- All signals scaled between 0 and 1
- Equal-weighted composite index used

Risk Index Interpretation:
- < 0.4 → low stress
- 0.4–0.7 → elevated stress
- > 0.7 → high-risk regime

--------------------------------------------------
KEY OBSERVATION
--------------------------------------------------
The risk index rises mainly during the later stages of drawdowns.
This behavior is intentional and reflects a confirmation-based,
conservative risk management approach.

--------------------------------------------------
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------------------------
- Reliability over early but noisy warnings
- Interpretability over model complexity
- No optimization or machine learning used
- Focus on regime detection, not timing trades

--------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS PROJECT IS NOT
--------------------------------------------------
- Not a trading strategy
- Not a price prediction model
- Not optimized to historical crashes
- Not machine-learning driven

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL TAKEAWAY
--------------------------------------------------
Crypto market crashes emerge from the accumulation of stress
across volume, volatility, and price dynamics.
Combining simple, interpretable signals into a composite
risk index provides a robust way to identify high-risk
market regimes objectively.
