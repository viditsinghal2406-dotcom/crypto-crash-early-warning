NOTES 01  DATA COLLECTION

- Used ccxt to fetch BTC/USDT daily OHLCV data from Binance
- Daily timeframe chosen because crashes are structural, not intraday
- OHLCV = open, high, low, close, volume
- Converted timestamp to date and set as index
- Visualized BTC price before doing any analysis

Important:
- Plotting first helps understand market structure
- Raw data must be saved before analysis
- Nothing is saved unless df.to_csv() is used

Confusion I had:
- Colab vs local files
- Memory vs disk storage
