NOTES 03  EARLY WARNING RISK SIGNALS

Goal of this stage:
The aim is not to predict price, but to detect rising market stress
before drawdowns deepen into full crashes.

This notebook focuses on simple, interpretable signals.

--------------------------------------------------
WHY WE NEED RISK SIGNALS
--------------------------------------------------
Drawdowns tell us a crash has already happened or is happening.
Risk signals help us understand whether stress is building BEFORE that.

Think of this as:
- Drawdown = damage already done
- Risk signals = warning signs

--------------------------------------------------
SIGNAL 1 — VOLUME SPIKES
--------------------------------------------------
Idea:
Volume shows how emotional and urgent market participants are.

Why it matters before crashes:
- Panic selling increases volume
- Large players exit positions quietly
- Distribution happens before price collapses

Key insight:
Price can move without conviction, but high volume means strong intent.

Implementation:
Volume ratio = current volume / 30-day average volume

Interpretation:
- Volume ratio ~1 → normal market
- Sustained volume spikes → stress building

--------------------------------------------------
SIGNAL 2 — VOLATILITY EXPANSION
--------------------------------------------------
Idea:
Volatility measures how unstable price movements are.

Market behavior:
- Calm markets have low volatility
- Stressed markets have high volatility

Why it signals regime change:
- Rising volatility means confidence is breaking
- Market participants disagree on value
- Transitions from stable to chaotic behavior

Key insight:
Volatility expansion often happens before or during crashes.

--------------------------------------------------
SIGNAL 3 — DRAWDOWN MOMENTUM
--------------------------------------------------
Idea:
Not just how big the loss is, but how fast it is getting worse.

Difference:
- Drawdown depth = how far price has fallen
- Drawdown momentum = how quickly losses are accelerating

Why it matters:
A fast-worsening drawdown indicates loss of control.
This often precedes deeper crash regimes.

Analogy:
Depth = how many steps you’ve fallen
Momentum = how fast you’re falling

--------------------------------------------------
WHY MULTIPLE WEAK SIGNALS MATTER
--------------------------------------------------
No single signal is reliable on its own.

One signal can:
- Give false alarms
- React late
- Be noisy

Multiple signals together:
- Reduce false positives
- Capture different dimensions of stress
- Increase confidence in risk assessment

Analogy:
Like medical symptoms — one symptom is weak,
multiple symptoms together indicate real danger.

--------------------------------------------------
KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------
- Volume captures market emotion and panic
- Volatility captures uncertainty and instability
- Drawdown momentum captures acceleration of losses
- Crashes emerge from combined stress, not one indicator

These signals are descriptive, not predictive.
They help identify high-risk regimes rather than exact crash timing.

NEXT STEP
--------------------------------------------------
Combine these individual signals into a single
composite risk score to quantify overall market stress.
