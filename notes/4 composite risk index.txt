NOTES 04  COMPOSITE RISK INDEX

Purpose of this notebook:
Combine multiple early-warning risk signals into a single
composite risk index that reflects overall market stress.

The goal is to summarize market risk, not predict prices.

--------------------------------------------------
WHY A COMPOSITE INDEX IS NEEDED
--------------------------------------------------
Individual signals (volume, volatility, drawdowns) are noisy.
Each signal captures only one aspect of market behavior.

A composite index:
- Aggregates different dimensions of risk
- Reduces reliance on any single indicator
- Provides a clearer picture of overall stress

--------------------------------------------------
SIGNALS USED IN THE INDEX
--------------------------------------------------
1. Volume Stress
   - Captures abnormal trading activity
   - Indicates panic, urgency, or distribution

2. Volatility Expansion
   - Captures instability and uncertainty
   - Signals transition from calm to stressed regimes

3. Drawdown Momentum
   - Captures acceleration of losses
   - Reflects worsening downside pressure

Each signal represents a different risk dimension.

--------------------------------------------------
WHY NORMALIZATION IS REQUIRED
--------------------------------------------------
Signals have different units and scales:
- Volume ratio
- Volatility
- Drawdown changes

Without normalization:
- One signal could dominate the index unfairly

Solution used:
- Rolling percentile normalization
- Converts all signals to a 0–1 scale
- Makes signals comparable over time

--------------------------------------------------
COMPOSITE RISK INDEX DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------
- Signals are equally weighted
- No optimization or tuning performed
- Emphasis on simplicity and transparency

Formula (conceptually):
Risk Index = Average of normalized risk signals

This avoids overfitting and keeps the system interpretable.

--------------------------------------------------
OBSERVED BEHAVIOR
--------------------------------------------------
- Risk index rises mainly during later stages of drawdowns
- Strong alignment with confirmed crash regimes
- Limited early false alarms

This behavior indicates a conservative,
confirmation-based risk system.

--------------------------------------------------
INTERPRETATION OF RISK LEVELS
--------------------------------------------------
- Low values → normal market conditions
- Mid-range values → elevated stress
- High values → high-risk or crash regime

Sustained high risk values are more important
than short-lived spikes.

--------------------------------------------------
DESIGN CHOICE
--------------------------------------------------
The index is intentionally conservative.
It prioritizes reliability over early detection.

Earlier signals are possible by adjusting:
- Rolling window length
- Signal weights

These changes were intentionally not applied
to preserve robustness.

--------------------------------------------------
KEY TAKEAWAY FROM NOTEBOOK 04
--------------------------------------------------
Combining simple, interpretable signals into a composite
index provides a clearer and more reliable view of
overall market risk than individual indicators alone.
