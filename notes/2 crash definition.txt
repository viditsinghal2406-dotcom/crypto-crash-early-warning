NOTES 02 CRASH DEFINITION

Key concept:
- A crash is defined using drawdowns, not daily returns

Drawdown formula:
(Price - Peak) / Peak

Understanding:
- Peak is the highest price seen so far (cummax)
- Drawdowns are always <= 0
- -0.30 means 30% fall from peak

Thresholds used:
- Stress: <= -20%
- Crash: <= -30%
- Severe Crash: <= -50%

Insights:
- Crashes are prolonged regimes, not single days
- Drawdowns cluster during bear markets
- Regime labeling removes subjectivity

This feels important for interviews.
